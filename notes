Kunne man lave point til et interface og s√• kunne man have en bestemt type til dimensionen???

## Phase 1
Make the general logic for 2d
Just make it work and add the needed utilities and tools.
Do not focus on make it smart - just make it work.
--- DONE ---

## Phase 2
Make Point class support that it can take any dimension
Make the logic support this change to the Point.java
--- DONE ---

## Phase 3 (compositional design phase)
Put the the parts that have different approaches for each new dimension.
points of interest is:
   - dividePoints
   - presort
   - perhaps also slab traversal.
        - Check this out in next phase
--- DONE ---

## Phase 3.1
Consider making factories.
--- DONE ---

## Phase 4
Make slow 3d algorithm in O(n lg^2 n) in the compositional architechture implemented in previous phase
Verify it
--- DONE ---

## Phase 4.1
For the sake of the easiness of making any further strategies - implement 4d in compositional design

## Phase 5
Make the fast algorithm in 3d supporting the design.
    - This is the one that takes all the coordinate axis into consideration.

## Phase 5.1
Make a k-dimensional implementation. (perhaps not possible without implementation 2d,3d,4d,...,k-1d, kd)
